# Hackerstat

HackerStat is a website that allows developers to be able aggregate their achievements, work experience, and code into one place that is accessible to recruiters and other developers. HackerStat allows multiple integrations for developers to connect their work from other sites (i.e. Github) to their HackerStat Profile. One important thing we do enforce in some of our integrations so far is verification. Certain integrations can be added only through a OAuth process with that integration's website.

### Integrations

HackerStat allows developers to add intergrations for:

1. GitHub
2. GitLab
3. WakaTime
4. Work Experience
5. StackOverflow
6. Medium
7. Twitter

HackerStat enforces verification by OAuth or other means to these integrations:

- GitHub

### Getting Started

If you are interested in downloading this repo, here are some steps:

1. You need to message Repo Member [Cgunter1](https://github.com/Cgunter1) and ask for the _.env.local_ file. This file will allow access to important features for the app (i.e. Auth0).
2. Next, you need to add that _.env.local_ file to the root of the repo.
3. Then you need to go on the command line in the root of the repo and run `npm i`. This will download all the files to get the repo running.
4. Lastly, you need to run `npm run dev` in the root of the repo. This command will run the website on <localhost:3000>.
